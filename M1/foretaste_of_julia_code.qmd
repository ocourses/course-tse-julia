Julia is a high-level, high-performance programming language primarily designed for numerical and scientific computing. Its syntax is familiar to users of other technical computing environments, while its flexibility and performance make it an excellent choice for a wide range of applications. In this section, we will look at a few simple examples to illustrate some core features of Julia and demonstrate its intuitive and powerful design.

## Variables

### Simple Assignment

In Julia, you can assign values to variables directly:

```{julia}
x = 1   # Assign an integer to x
2x      # The result of 2 * x
```

### Mathematical Operations

You can also perform mathematical operations directly on variables:

```{julia}
x = sqrt(2)    # Assign the square root of 2 to x
x              # Output the value of x
```

### Using Unicode

Julia allows you to use Unicode characters in your code, which makes it more expressive:

```{julia}
# Unicode is great
x = √(2)        # Square root symbol for 2
x               # The value of x is the square root of 2
```

### Custom Variable Names

Julia even allows using emojis for variable names:

```{julia}
😄 = sqrt(2)    # Assign the square root of 2 to the emoji variable
2😄              # Result of 2 times 😄
```

## Functions

### Simple Function Definition

In Julia, you can define a function using the `function` keyword:

```{julia}
# this is a function
function f(x)
  return 2x + 1   # Return a value that is double x plus 1
end
```

To evaluate a function, simply call it with an argument:

```{julia}
f(2)  # Output: 5
```

### Anonymous Functions

Julia also supports anonymous functions (functions without a name), which are often used for short operations:

```{julia}
# This is also a function
g(x) = 2x + 1   # A shorthand for defining a function
g(2)            # Output: 5
```

```{julia}
# Another example with anonymous function
h = x -> 2x^2    # Function definition using the arrow syntax
h(1)             # Output: 2, since 2 * 1^2 = 2
```

### Function Priority and Operator Precedence

In some cases, you need to be cautious about operator precedence:

```{julia}
# Be careful of operator priorities
h(1 + 1)  # The correct evaluation is 2 * (1+1)^2 = 8
```

## Side Effects

In Julia, functions can have **side effects**, meaning they modify variables or objects outside the scope of the function. Here’s an example:

### Mutating Vectors

Let's consider the following vector:

```{julia}
x = [1, 3, 12]
```

You can access an element of the vector like this:

```{julia}
x[2]  # Output: 3, the second element of the array
```

To update an element, simply reassign it:

```{julia}
x[2] = 5  # Changes the second element to 5
x         # Now x = [1, 5, 12]
```

### Side Effects in Functions

If you mutate data inside a function, it will have side effects. For example, consider this function:

```{julia}
function f(x, y)
    x[1] = 42        # Mutates x
    y = 7 + sum(x)   # New binding for y, no mutation
    return y
end

a = [4, 5, 6]
b = 3

println("f($a, $b) = ", f(a, b))  # f modifies 'a' but not 'b'
println("a = ", a, " # a[1] is changed to 42 by f")
println("b = ", b, " # b remains unchanged")
```

### The Bang Convention

When a function has side effects, it's a good practice to use the `!` symbol at the end of the function's name. This is called the **bang convention**, and it signals that the function mutates its arguments:

```{julia}
function put_at_second_place!(x, value)
  x[2] = value
  return nothing  # No explicit return, it's just a side effect
end

x = [1, 3, 12]
println("x[2] before: ", x[2])

put_at_second_place!(x, 5)  # Mutates x
println("x[2] after: ", x[2])
```

### Caution with Slices

Be cautious when passing slices of arrays to functions. Modifying a slice can also modify the original array:

```{julia}
put_at_second_place!(x[1:3], 15)  # Be careful with slices
println("x[2] after slice mutation: ", x[2])
```

::: {.callout-warning}
When a function modifies mutable objects, it can lead to unexpected results. Always be mindful of what is passed into functions.
:::

## Methods

Julia supports multiple methods for the same function name, which allows for more flexible and dynamic behavior. Here's an example:

### Method Overloading

You can define several methods for the same function with different types:

```{julia}
Σ(x::Float64, y::Float64) = 2x + y   # Method for Float64 inputs
```

Calling the function:

```{julia}
Σ(2.0, 3.0)  # Output: 7.0
```

If you call `Σ` with arguments that don't match the types, Julia will throw an error:

```{julia}
#| error: true
Σ(2, 3.0)  # Error: no method matching Σ(::Int64, ::Float64)
```

### Multiple Methods for Different Types

You can define more methods that work with different types:

```{julia}
φ(x::Number, y::Number) = 2x - y           # General method for numbers
φ(x::Int, y::Int)     = 2x * y             # Method for integers
φ(x::Float64, y::Float64) = 2x + y         # Method for Float64
```

### Method Dispatch Example

Julia will select the appropriate method based on the argument types:

```{julia}
println("φ(2,   3.0) = ", φ(2, 3.0))       # Uses general method
println("φ(2,   3)   = ", φ(2, 3))         # Uses the integer method
println("φ(2.0, 3.0) = ", φ(2.0, 3.0))     # Uses the Float64 method
```

## Iterators

In Julia, iterators allow you to loop through collections in a memory-efficient way. Here’s an example of using `1:5` as an iterator:

```{julia}
for i in 1:5
    println(i)
end
```

This prints the numbers from 1 to 5. You can also iterate through ranges and collections:

```{julia}
for i in [10, 20, 30]
    println(i)
end
```

### Working with Lazy Collections

Julia’s `Iterators` package allows for lazy collections, where values are computed on demand. Here’s an example:

```{julia}
using Base.Iterators: cycle
for i in cycle([1, 2, 3])
    println(i)
    if i == 3
        break
    end
end
```

This loops over the values 1, 2, and 3, repeating as a cycle.

## Types and Type Stability

### Type Stability

Julia has **type stability** for fast compilation and execution. When writing functions, it's important to ensure that the type of the return value can be determined without ambiguity. Here's an example:

```{julia}
function f(x)
    if x > 0
        return 1
    else
        return 0.0
    end
end

println(typeof(f(2)))   # Output: Int64
println(typeof(f(-2)))  # Output: Float64
```

Julia is dynamically typed, but ensuring **type stability** within functions helps the compiler optimize code for better performance.

::: {.callout-tip}
For better performance, always try to ensure type stability in your functions. This can be achieved by making the return type predictable, from the types of input variables and not their values.

## Exercise

### Least Squares Regression Line

We propose a first exercise about [simple linear regression](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simple_linear_regression). The data are excerpted from this [example](https://www.ncl.ac.uk/webtemplate/ask-assets/external/maths-resources/statistics/regression-and-correlation/simple-linear-regression.html) and saved into [data.csv](data.csv). We propose an [ordinary least squares](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ordinary_least_squares) formulation which is a type of [linear least squares](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear_least_squares) method for choosing the unknown parameters in a linear regression model by the principle of least squares: minimizing the sum of the squares of the differences between the observed dependent variable (values of the variable being observed) in the input dataset and the output of the (linear) function of the independent variable.

Given a set of $m$ data points $y_{1}$, $y_{2}$, $\dots$, $y_{m}$, consisting of experimentally measured values taken at $m$ values $x_{1}$, $x_{2}$, $\dots$, $x_{m}$ of an independent variable ($x_i$ may be scalar or vector quantities), and given a model function $y=f(x,\beta),$ with $\beta =(\beta_{1},\beta_{2},\dots ,\beta_{n})$, it is desired to find the parameters $\beta_j$ such that the model function "best" fits the data. In linear least squares, linearity is meant to be with respect to parameters $\beta_j$, so
$$
  f(x, \beta) = \sum_{j=1}^n \beta_j\, \varphi_j(x).
$$
In general, the functions $\varphi_j$ may be nonlinear. However, we consider linear regression, that is
$$
  f(x, \beta) = \beta_1 + \beta_2 x.
$$
Ideally, the model function fits the data exactly, so 
$$
  y_i = f(x_i, \beta)
$$
for all $i=1, 2, \dots, m$. This is usually not possible in practice, as there are more data points than there are parameters to be determined. The approach chosen then is to find the minimal possible value of the sum of squares of the residuals
$$
  r_i(\beta) = y_i - f(x_i, \beta), \quad i=1, 2, \dots, m
$$
so to minimize the function
$$
  S(\beta) = \sum_{i=1}^m r_i^2(\beta).
$$
In the linear least squares case, the residuals are of the form
$$
  r(\beta) = y - X\, \beta
$$
with $y = (y_i)_{1\le i\le m} \in \mathbb{R}^m$ and $X = (X_{ij})_{1\le i\le m, 1\le j\le n} \in \mathrm{M}_{mn}(\mathbb{R})$, where $X_{ij} = \varphi_j(x_i)$. Since we consider linear regression, the $i$-th row of the matrix $X$ is given by
$$
  X_{i[:]} = [1 \quad x_i].
$$
The objective function may be written
$$
  S(\beta) = {\Vert y - X\, \beta \Vert}^2
$$
where the norm is the usual $2$-norm. The solution to the linear least squares problem
$$
  \underset{\beta \in \mathbb{R}^n}{\mathrm{minimize}}\, {\Vert y - X\, \beta \Vert}^2
$$
is computed by solving the *normal equation*
$$
  X^\top X\, \beta = X^\top y,
$$
where $X^\top$ denotes the transpose of $X$.

### Questions

To answer the questions you need to import the following packages.

```{julia}
using DataFrames
using CSV
using Plots
```

You also need to download the csv file. Click on the following image.

<a href="data/introduction/data.csv" download>
  <img src="../assets/images/logo-csv-download.png" width="50">
</a>

1. Using the packages `DataFrames.jl` and `CSV.jl`, load the dataset from [data/introduction/data.csv](data/introduction/data.csv) and save the result into a variable named `dataset`.

```{julia}
#| code-fold: true
#| code-summary: "Show the answer"
path = "data/introduction/data.csv" # update depending on the location of your file
dataset = DataFrame(CSV.File(path))
```

::: {.callout-note}
Do not hesitate to visit the documentation of `CSV.jl` and `DataFrames.jl`.
:::

2. Using the package `Plot.jl`, plot the data. 

::: {.callout-tip collapse="true"}
## Hint

Use `names(dataset)` to get the list of data names. If `Time` is a name you can access to the associated data by `dataset.Time`.
:::

```{julia}
#| code-fold: true
#| code-summary: "Show the answer"
plt = plot(
  dataset.Time, 
  dataset.Mass,
  seriestype=:scatter, 
  legend=false, 
  xlabel="Time", 
  ylabel="Mass"
)
```

1. Create the matrix $X$, the vector $\beta$ and solve the normal equation with the operator [`Base.\`](https://tinyurl.com/juliadoc-base-backslash).

::: {.callout-tip collapse="true"}
## Hint

Use `ones(m)` to generate a vector of 1 of length $m$.
:::

```{julia}
#| code-fold: true
#| code-summary: "Show the answer"
m = length(dataset.Time)
X = [ones(m) dataset.Time]
y = dataset.Mass
β = X\y
```

4. Plot the linear model on the same plot as the data. Use the `plot!` function. See the [basic concepts for plotting](https://docs.juliaplots.org/stable/basics/#Basic-Concepts).

```{julia}
#| code-fold: true
#| code-summary: "Show the answer"
x = [5, 20]
y = β[1] .+ β[2]*x
plot!(plt, x, y)
```
