Paraphrasing [Why Julia?](https://juliahub.com/assets/pdf/why_julia.pdf), 
Julia is a fast and expressive programming language, delivering the speed of C++
and Fortran together with the productivity of Python, MATLAB, and R. This
fundamentally empowers diverse teams to work together to develop and deploy
performant programs at scale by solving the [two language problem](https://scientificcoder.com/how-to-solve-the-two-language-problem).

## Benefits of Julia

Julia combines the speed of low-level languages like C++ and Fortran with the productivity of high-level languages like Python, MATLAB, and R. Here are some of its key benefits:

- **High Performance**: Optimized for native compilation, multi-threading, and GPU compute, Julia can achieve speeds close to C++.
- **High Productivity**: Expressive and dynamic, Julia is up to 100x faster than traditional high-level languages.
- **Ease of Use**: Clear and simple syntax, making it easy to learn, write, and analyze.
- **Composability**: Packages are designed to work seamlessly together and with custom code.
- **Interoperability**: Julia integrates well with languages like Python, R, C++, and Java.
- **Unified Language**: Supports both prototyping and deployment, solving the two-language problem.
- **Rich Ecosystem**: More than 10,000 registered packages and a large community of contributors.

## The Two-Language Problem

Traditionally, programming required both a high-level, slower language for prototyping and a low-level, faster language for production, causing inefficiencies. Julia unifies these two needs into one language, allowing:

| Aspect                       | High-Level Language (e.g., Python)    | Low-Level Language (e.g., C++) |
|------------------------------|---------------------------------------|--------------------------------|
| **Pros**                     | Easy to write and read               | Fast in production             |
| **Cons**                     | Slow in production                   | Complex, lengthy code          |
| **Juliaâ€™s Solution**         | Combines ease of high-level with speed of low-level, eliminating the need for separate languages for research and production. |

## Comparisons

creators of numerical-analysis softwares, please visite the [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparison_of_numerical-analysis_software) page.

Julia is made for scientific computing as shown by the table below which compares some languages in terms
of differential equation solvers. For more details visit this [page](https://www.stochasticlifestyle.com/comparison-differential-equation-solver-suites-matlab-r-julia-python-c-fortran/).

One goal of Julia is to be efficient and high-level. This is illustrated by the following figure 
given by the [Mandelbrot benchmark project](https://benchmarksgame-team.pages.debian.net/benchmarksgame/description/mandelbrot.html#mandelbrot).
