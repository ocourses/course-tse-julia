In Julia, understanding the fundamental types and data structures is essential for efficient coding and problem-solving. This page provides an introduction to some of the basic types in Julia, including integers, floating-point numbers, strings, and composite types like arrays and tuples. We’ll also explore more advanced data structures and their practical uses.

You'll learn about:

- **Basic Types** such as integers, floating-point numbers, and strings.
- **Data Structures** like arrays, vectors, matrices, dictionaries, tuples, and `NamedTuple`.
- The importance of **Type Declarations** and how to use them effectively.
- How to work with **Collections** and **Composite Types** to model more complex data.

Whether you're a beginner or looking to deepen your understanding of Julia's type system, this page will help you get familiar with the core building blocks for handling data efficiently in Julia.

## Introduction to Types in Julia

Julia is a dynamically typed language, meaning that variable types are determined at runtime. However, Julia also supports strong typing, which means that types are important and can be explicitly specified when needed. Understanding types in Julia is essential for writing efficient code, as the language uses Just-In-Time (JIT) compilation to optimize based on variable types.

### Dynamic Typing
In Julia, variables do not require explicit type declarations. The type of a variable is inferred based on the value assigned to it.

```{julia}
@myshow begin #| hide
x = 10          # x is inferred to be of type Int64
y = 3.14        # y is inferred to be of type Float64
z = "Hello"     # z is inferred to be of type String

typeof(x), typeof(y), typeof(z)
end #| hide
```

Even though Julia automatically infers types, you can still explicitly specify them when necessary, particularly for performance optimization or for ensuring that a variable matches a particular type.

### Strong Typing
While Julia uses dynamic typing, it is strongly typed. This means that Julia will enforce type constraints on operations, and will raise errors when an operation is attempted with incompatible types.

You can add an integer and a float,

```{julia}
#| error: true
@myshow begin #| hide
n = 5           # Integer
x = 2.0         # Float
n + x           # we can add an Int64 and a Float64
end #| hide
```

but you cannot add an integer and a string:

```{julia}
#| error: true
@myshow begin #| hide
s = "Hello"     # String
n + s           # Error: does not make sense to add an Int64 and a String
end #| hide
```

We see from the error message that we can add an Integer and a Char: `+(::Integer, ::AbstractChar)` is a valid operation. This is because a Char can be treated as an integer in Julia.

```{julia}
@myshow begin #| hide
c = 'a'      # Char
c + 128448   # This will work because Char can be treated as an integer
end #| hide
```

Julia allows flexibility compared to statically typed languages like C or Java, but still ensures that operations make sense for the types involved.

### Type System and Performance
The type system in Julia plays a key role in performance. By inferring or specifying types, Julia's JIT compiler can optimize code for specific data types, leading to faster execution. For example, when types are known at compile time, Julia can generate machine code tailored for the specific types involved.

Julia’s type system also supports abstract types, allowing for more flexible and generic code, as well as parametric types that let you define functions or types that work with any data type.

### Summary
- Julia is dynamically typed but enforces strong typing.
- Types are inferred from the values assigned to variables.
- Julia optimizes performance based on types, making type information crucial.

## Basic Types

Julia has several basic (or primitive) types that are fundamental to working with the language. These include numerical types, characters, and strings. Understanding these types is crucial as they form the building blocks for more complex data structures.

### Common Basic Types

- **`Int`**: Represents integer values. Julia has multiple types of integers, such as `Int8`, `Int16`, `Int32`, and `Int64` depending on the desired size. By default, `Int` refers to the most appropriate integer type for the system (usually `Int64` on modern systems).
  
- **`Float64`**: Represents floating-point numbers with double precision.
  
- **`String`**: Represents sequences of characters.

- **`Bool`**: Represents Boolean values, i.e., `true` or `false`.

- **`Char`**: Represents individual Unicode characters.

### Example Usage of Basic Types

```{julia}
# Integer type (default is Int64)
a = 42         # a is of type Int64

# Float type (default is Float64)
b = 3.14       # b is of type Float64

# String type
c = "Hello"    # c is of type String

# Boolean type
d = true       # d is of type Bool

# Char type
e = 'α'        # e is of type Char
nothing #| hide
```

These basic types are often used for simple calculations and conditionals. Julia allows operations between different types, but it will raise an error if the types are incompatible.

## Collections and Data Structures

### Julia as an Array Programming Language

Julia is designed as an [array programming language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Array_programming), focusing on operations that apply to entire arrays or subarrays rather than individual elements. This paradigm simplifies code for numerical, scientific, and data-intensive applications. By leveraging features like broadcasting and vectorized operations, Julia allows for efficient and concise code, enhancing performance without sacrificing readability. Array programming is central to Julia’s capabilities, enabling fast computation on large datasets and making it ideal for high-performance scientific computing.

### Arrays, Vectors, and Matrices

In Julia, [arrays](https://docs.julialang.org/en/v1/manual/arrays/) are fundamental data structures that can hold elements of any type. Arrays can be one-dimensional (vectors) or two-dimensional (matrices), and they can hold data of various types.

- **Creating an Array**:

```{julia}
arr = [1, 2, 3, 4]  # A simple 1D array (vector)
```

```{julia}
matrix = [1 2 3; 4 5 6]  # A 2D array (matrix)
```

- **Accessing Array Elements**:

```{julia}
arr[1]   # Access the first element of the array
```

```{julia}
matrix[2, 3]  # Access the element in the second row, third column
```

#### Slicing of Vectors and Matrices

You can extract slices (sub-arrays) of vectors and matrices in Julia. The slicing syntax allows you to access specific portions of an array.

- **Slicing a vector**:

```{julia}
arr[2:4]  # Extracts elements from index 2 to 4: [2, 3, 4]
```

- **Slicing a matrix**:

```{julia}
matrix[1, :]   # Extracts the first row: [1, 2, 3]
```

```{julia}
matrix[:, 2]   # Extracts the second column: [2, 5]
```

#### Mutation of Arrays

Arrays in Julia are mutable, meaning their elements can be changed after creation. The `.=` operator is commonly used to apply element-wise operations.

- **Modify an individual element**:

```{julia}
arr[2] = 99  # Change the second element to 99
```

- **Element-wise operation with `.=`**:

```{julia}
arr .+= 10  # Adds 10 to each element of the array, resulting in [11, 12, 13, 14]
```

```{julia}
matrix .*= 2  # Multiplies each element of the matrix by 2, resulting in [2 4 6; 8 10 12]
```

- **Push an element into an array** (mutates the array by adding a new element):

```{julia}
push!(arr, 40)  # Adds 40 to the end of the array
```

- **Pop an element from an array** (removes the last element):

```{julia}
pop!(arr)  # Removes the last element, which is 40 in this case
```

#### Mutation Inside a Function

When working with arrays inside a function, it's important to note that reassigning the entire array (e.g., `v = [1, 2]`) does not mutate the original array but rather creates a new one locally scoped to the function. To modify the contents of an array in place, use either `v[:] = ...` or the more flexible broadcasting syntax `v .= ...`.

- **Incorrect way** (does not mutate the original vector):

```{julia}
function incorrect_mutate(v)
    v = [1, 2]  # This creates a new array and does not affect the input
end

vec = [10, 20]
incorrect_mutate(vec)
println(vec)  # Outputs: [10, 20]
```

- **Correct way** using `v[:] = ...`:

```{julia}
function correct_mutate(v)
    v[:] = [1, 2]  # Mutates the input vector
end

vec = [10, 20]
correct_mutate(vec)
println(vec)  # Outputs: [1, 2]
```

- **Using broadcasting (`v .= ...`)**:

```{julia}
function flexible_mutate(v)
    v .= [1, 2]  # More flexible, works for both vectors and matrices
end

vec = [10, 20]
flexible_mutate(vec)
println(vec)  # Outputs: [1, 2]

mat = [10 20; 30 40]
mat .= [1 2; 3 4]  # Updates all elements in-place
println(mat)  # Outputs: [1 2; 3 4]
```

Using `v .= ...` is preferred for its flexibility, as it works seamlessly for arrays of any shape, including matrices. Without broadcasting, you would need to use `M[:, :] = ...` for matrices to achieve the same effect.

#### Special Arrays

Julia has built-in functions to create arrays with predefined values:

- **Create an array of zeros**:

```{julia}
zeros(3)  # Creates an array of zeros with 3 elements: [0.0, 0.0, 0.0]
```

- **Create an array of ones**:

```{julia}
ones(2, 3)  # Creates a 2x3 matrix filled with ones: [1.0 1.0 1.0; 1.0 1.0 1.0]
```

### Dictionaries (Dict)

A [`Dict`](https://docs.julialang.org/en/v1/base/collections/#Dictionaries) in Julia is an associative collection that maps keys to values. This allows for efficient lookups, insertions, and deletions based on unique keys.

- **Creating a Dictionary**:

```{julia}
d = Dict("name" => "Alice", "age" => 25)
```

This creates a dictionary where `"name"` maps to `"Alice"` and `"age"` maps to `25`.

- **Accessing Values**:
  
You can access values in a dictionary using their corresponding keys:

```{julia}
d["name"]  # Outputs: "Alice"
```

- **Adding and Updating Values**:

To add a new key-value pair or update an existing one, you can use the following syntax:

```{julia}
d["location"] = "Paris"  # Adds a new key-value pair
d["age"] = 26            # Updates the value associated with the key "age"
display(d)
```

- **Removing Key-Value Pairs**:

To remove a key-value pair, use the `delete!` function:

```{julia}
delete!(d, "location")
```

- **Iteration over Key-Value Pairs**:

You can iterate through the keys, values, or pairs in a dictionary using `keys`, `values`, and `pairs` respectively:

```{julia}
for (k, v) in pairs(d)
    println("Key: $k, Value: $v")
end
```

### Tuples and Named Tuples

Julia [Tuples](https://docs.julialang.org/en/v1/manual/types/#Tuple-Types) are ordered collections of elements, while [Named Tuples](https://docs.julialang.org/en/v1/manual/types/#Named-Tuple-Types) are tuples where elements are associated with names (keys). Tuples are immutable, meaning their elements cannot be changed after creation.

#### Basic usage of Tuples and Named Tuples

- **Tuple** is an ordered collection of elements, which can hold elements of different types.

```{julia}
t = (1, "Julia", true)  # A tuple with three elements
```

- **NamedTuple** is a special kind of tuple where elements are associated with names (keys).

```{julia}
nt = (name = "Alice", age = 25)  # A NamedTuple with named fields
```

You can access the elements by their name:

```{julia}
nt.name  # Access the field 'name' of the NamedTuple, returns "Alice"
```

- **Mutation of a Tuple**: Tuples are immutable, so attempting to change their elements will result in an error.

```{julia}
#| error: true
t[1] = 99  # Trying to modify a tuple element will result in an error
```

The above line will raise an error because tuples are immutable in Julia, and their elements cannot be modified after creation.

#### Tuples in Function

In Julia, tuples and named tuples play an important role in function definitions and return values.

- **Positional and Keyword Arguments**:  
  
When defining functions with a variable number of arguments, Julia uses *tuples* to capture positional arguments and *named tuples* for keyword arguments:

```{julia}
function example_function(args...; kwargs...)
    println("Positional arguments type: ", typeof(args))
    println("Keyword arguments type: ", typeof(kwargs))
    return kwargs
end

kw = example_function(1, 2, 3; name="Alice", age=30)
nothing #| hide
```

In this example, `args` is of type `Tuple`, containing all positional arguments, while `kwargs` is based on a `NamedTuple`, containing all keyword arguments. The arguments are captured using the `args...` and `kwargs...` syntax. The `kwargs` argument is actually a 'Base.Pairs':

```{julia}
kw
```

```{julia}
@myshow begin #| hide
typeof(kw)
kw isa Base.Pairs
kw isa AbstractDict
keys(kw)
values(kw)
pairs(kw)
kw[:name]
kw[:age]
end #| hide
```

Actually, the values are a `NamedTuple`:

```{julia}
typeof(values(kw))
```

Contrary to a `Dict`, you cannot add entries to a `Base.Pairs`:

```{julia}
#| error: true
kw[:height] = 5.9
```

- **Returning Tuples**:

In Julia, when a function returns multiple values separated by commas, they are automatically returned as a tuple:

```{julia}
function return_multiple_values()
    return 1, "Julia", true
end

result = return_multiple_values()
println("Result type: ", typeof(result))
```

So, `return_multiple_values()` returns a tuple with three elements.

## Composite Types

### Introduction to `struct`

In Julia, you can define your own custom data types using the `struct` keyword. [Composite types](https://docs.julialang.org/en/v1/manual/types/#Composite-Types) are user-defined types that group together different pieces of data into one object. A `struct` is a great way to create a type that can represent a complex entity with multiple fields.

- **Creating a custom `struct`**:

```{julia}
# Define a simple struct for a point in 2D space
struct Point
    x::Float64
    y::Float64
end
```

Here, we created a `Point` struct with two fields: `x` and `y`, both of which are of type `Float64`.

- **Creating an instance of a struct**:

```{julia}
p = Point(3.0, 4.0)  # Creates a Point with x = 3.0 and y = 4.0
```

- **Accessing fields of a struct**:

```{julia}
p.x  # Access the 'x' field of the Point instance
p.y  # Access the 'y' field of the Point instance
```

You can access the fields of a struct directly using dot notation, as shown above.

- **Get the names of the fields**:

```{julia}
fieldnames(Point)  # Returns the names of the fields in the Point struct
```

### Mutability of `struct`

In Julia, structs are **immutable** by default, meaning once you create an instance of a struct, its fields cannot be changed. However, you can create **mutable structs** by using the `mutable struct` keyword, which allows modification of field values after creation.

- **Creating a mutable struct**:

```{julia}
mutable struct MutablePoint
    x::Float64
    y::Float64
end
```

Now you can modify the fields of `MutablePoint` instances after they are created.

```{julia}
mp = MutablePoint(1.0, 2.0)
mp.x = 3.0  # Modify the 'x' field
nothing #| hide
```

### Example: `struct` for a Circle

We can create a more complex type, such as a `Circle`, which has a center represented by a `Point` and a radius:

```{julia}
struct Circle
    center::Point
    radius::Float64
end
```

- **Creating an instance of `Circle`**:

```{julia}
c = Circle(Point(0.0, 0.0), 5.0)  # Create a circle with center (0, 0) and radius 5
```

- **Accessing fields of a nested struct**:

```{julia}
c.center.x  # Access the x field of the center of the circle
c.center.y  # Access the y field of the center of the circle
c.radius    # Access the radius of the circle
nothing #| hide
```

### Adding a Custom Constructor

Julia allows you to define custom constructors for structs. These constructors enable additional logic during object creation, such as validating inputs or providing default values. Here's an example of a custom constructor for a `Circle` that ensures the radius is always positive and converts the center coordinates to `Float64` if they are not already:

```{julia}
struct Circle
    center::Point
    radius::Float64
end

# Define a custom constructor
function Circle(x::Real, y::Real, radius::Real)
    if radius <= 0
        throw(DomainError(radius, "Radius must be positive"))
    end
    Circle(Point(float(x), float(y)), float(radius))
end
nothing #| hide
```

- **Explanation**:
  - The custom constructor accepts the center's `x` and `y` coordinates and the `radius` as inputs.
  - It checks if the radius is positive, throwing an error otherwise.
  - It converts the inputs to `Float64` using `float`, ensuring consistency with the field types defined in the `Circle` struct.

- **Usage**:

```{julia}
#| error: true

@myshow begin #| hide
# Create a Circle using the custom constructor
c = Circle(0, 0, 5)  # Creates a Circle with center (0.0, 0.0) and radius 5.0

# Attempt to create a Circle with an invalid radius
c = Circle(0, 0, -3)  # Throws an error: "Radius must be positive"
end #| hide
```

### Function-like Object (Callable `struct`)

In Julia, you can make a `struct` "callable" by defining the `call` method for it. This allows instances of the `struct` to be used like functions. This feature is useful for encapsulating parameters or states in a type while still allowing it to behave like a function.

Here’s an example that demonstrates a callable struct for a **linear transformation**:

```{julia}
# Define a callable struct for a linear transformation
struct LinearTransform
    a::Float64  # Slope
    b::Float64  # Intercept
end

# Define the call method for LinearTransform
function (lt::LinearTransform)(x::Real)
    lt.a * x + lt.b  # Apply the linear transformation
end
```

- **Explanation**:
  - The `LinearTransform` struct stores the parameters of the linear function \( y = ax + b \).
  - By defining the `call` method for the struct, you enable instances of `LinearTransform` to behave like a function.

- **Usage**:

```{julia}
# Create an instance of LinearTransform
lt = LinearTransform(2.0, 3.0)  # y = 2x + 3

@myshow begin #| hide
# Call the instance like a function
typeof(lt)  # Output: LinearTransform
y1 = lt(5)   # Calculates 2 * 5 + 3 = 13
y2 = lt(-1)  # Calculates 2 * -1 + 3 = 1
end #| hide
```

### Extending the Concept: Composable Linear Transforms

You can take this idea further by allowing composition of transformations. For example:

```{julia}
# Define a method to compose two LinearTransform objects
function (lt1::LinearTransform)(lt2::LinearTransform)
    LinearTransform(lt1.a * lt2.a, lt1.a * lt2.b + lt1.b)
end

# Example usage
lt1 = LinearTransform(2.0, 3.0)  # y = 2x + 3
lt2 = LinearTransform(0.5, 1.0)  # y = 0.5x + 1

# Compose the two transformations
lt_composed = lt1(lt2)  # Equivalent to y = 2 * (0.5x + 1) + 3

@myshow begin #| hide
# Call the composed transformation
y = lt_composed(4)  # Calculates 2 * (0.5 * 4 + 1) + 3 = 9
end #| hide
```

::: {.callout-note}
The previous composition is equivalent in pure Julia to:

```{julia}
y = (lt1 ∘ lt2)(4)
```
:::

### Conclusion

- In Julia, `struct` allows you to create complex custom types that can hold different types of data. Custom constructors provide flexibility for struct initialization, allowing validation and preprocessing of input data. This is especially useful for enforcing constraints and ensuring type consistency. By default, structs are immutable, but you can use `mutable struct` if you need to change the data after creation.
- Using a callable struct allows you to represent parameterized functions or transformations in a concise and reusable way. The concept can be extended further to support operations like composition or chaining, making it a powerful tool for [functional-style programming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_programming) in Julia.

## Exercises

1. **Define a `Point` struct** with `x` and `y` coordinates of type `Float64`.
2. **Define a `Rectangle` struct** with fields `length` and `width` of type `Float64`. Use the `Point` struct to represent the bottom-left corner of the rectangle.
3. **Define a `Circle` struct** with a `Point` for the center and a `radius` of type `Float64`.
4. Write a **function `area(shape)`** that computes the area of the given shape:
   - The area of a rectangle is `length * width`.
   - The area of a circle is `π * radius^2`.

### Exercise 3: Manipulating Tuples

1. Create a **tuple** `t` with three elements: a string, an integer, and a float.
2. Try to mutate the first element of the tuple and handle any errors using a `try-catch` block.
3. Create a **NamedTuple** `nt` with fields `name`, `age`, and `height`, and initialize it with your details.

::: {.callout-tip collapse="true" icon=false}
