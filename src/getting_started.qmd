## Introduction to Julia Programming Language

Welcome to the world of Julia! This section will introduce you to the language, explaining why it’s gaining popularity, and highlighting some key features that make Julia a unique tool for scientific computing and general-purpose programming.

### What is Julia?

Julia is a high-level, high-performance programming language primarily designed for technical computing. It combines the best features of other programming languages, including Python's ease of use, C's speed, and MATLAB's support for numerical computation. Julia is open-source and has become a go-to language for scientific research, data analysis, and machine learning applications.

### Why Julia?

- **High performance**: Julia is designed for performance from the ground up. It often performs on par with statically typed languages like C or Fortran, thanks to Just-In-Time (JIT) compilation using LLVM.
  
- **Multiple dispatch**: Julia uses multiple dispatch as its core paradigm, which allows for highly flexible and efficient function definitions.
  
- **Designed for scientific computing**: Julia excels in areas such as linear algebra, numerical analysis, and optimization, making it a great choice for data-heavy fields like economics, physics, and engineering.

- **Ease of use**: Julia offers a simple, intuitive syntax similar to Python and MATLAB, which makes it easy to learn and use, even for those with little programming experience.

## Installing Julia

### Download Julia

To get started with Julia, you first need to install the language on your computer. The official Julia website provides the installation files for various operating systems, including Windows, macOS, and Linux. Follow these steps:

1. Visit the official [Julia Downloads](https://julialang.org/downloads/) page.
2. Choose the appropriate version of Julia for your operating system.
3. Download the installer (the latest stable version is recommended for most users).

### Installation Instructions

Before you can start using Julia, you need to install it on your system. Below are the steps for installing Julia on different operating systems: Mac, Linux, and Windows.

::: {.panel-tabset}

### Mac / Linux

To install the latest stable version of Julia on Mac or Linux, follow these simple steps:

1. Open your terminal.
2. Run the following command to download and install Julia:

```bash
curl -fsSL https://install.julialang.org | sh
```

This command downloads the Julia installation script and runs it automatically. It will install Julia and place it in your /usr/local/bin directory by default.

### Windows

To install Julia on Windows, follow these steps:

1. Open the [Microsoft Store page for Julia](https://www.microsoft.com/store/apps/9NJNWW8PVKMN).
2. Click "Get" to download and install the latest version of Julia from the Microsoft Store.

Alternatively, you can install Julia using the Windows Package Manager (winget). Open the command prompt and run the following command:

```bash
winget install julia -s msstore
```

After installation, you can launch Julia by searching for it in the Start menu or by running julia in the command prompt.
:::

### Verify Installation

After installation, you can verify that Julia is correctly installed by opening a terminal or command prompt and typing the following command:

```bash
julia
```

This will launch the Julia REPL (Read-Eval-Print Loop), where you can start running Julia commands interactively. You should see something similar to the following:

```{julia}
#| echo: false
using REPL
io = IOBuffer()
REPL.banner(io)
banner = String(take!(io))
import Markdown
Markdown.parse("```julia\n$(banner)\njulia>\n```")
```

If you see this prompt, it means Julia is installed and working correctly!

### Discover the Package Manager

Julia includes a built-in [package manager](https://docs.julialang.org/en/v1/stdlib/Pkg/), `Pkg`, that allows you to easily manage external packages (libraries) for your projects.

1. To start using `Pkg`, open the Julia REPL and type:
   ```julia
   using Pkg
   ```

2. You can install a package by running:
   ```julia
   Pkg.add("PackageName")
   ```

For example, to install the popular plotting package `Plots`, run:
```julia
Pkg.add("Plots")
```

This will download and install the package, making it available for use in your Julia scripts.

## Using the Julia REPL

The [Julia REPL](https://docs.julialang.org/en/v1/stdlib/REPL/) (Read-Eval-Print Loop) is an interactive command-line environment for executing Julia code. It allows you to run Julia code line-by-line, evaluate expressions, and see the results immediately.

### Starting the REPL

To start the Julia REPL, open your terminal or command prompt and simply type:

```bash
julia
```

You should see the Julia prompt, which looks like this:

```{julia}
#| echo: false
using REPL
io = IOBuffer()
REPL.banner(io)
banner = String(take!(io))
import Markdown
Markdown.parse("```julia\n$(banner)\njulia>\n```")
```

This is the REPL where you can start typing Julia expressions.

### Basic Commands

In the REPL, you can type expressions and commands. For example:

- To perform a simple arithmetic operation, type:

```julia
3 + 4
```

The result will appear right below the command, like so:

```julia
7
```

- To assign a value to a variable, use the `=` sign:

```julia
x = 10
```

Now, `x` holds the value 10. You can use it in further expressions:

```julia
x * 2
```

The result will be:

```julia
20
```

### Using REPL Features

The Julia REPL has several features that make it more convenient to use:

1. **History:** You can use the up and down arrow keys to scroll through your command history and reuse previous commands.

2. **Tab Completion:** Type part of a function or variable name and press `Tab` to automatically complete it or show suggestions.

3. **Help:** Type `?` followed by a function or type name to get documentation directly in the REPL. For example:

```julia
?sum
```

This will show information about the `sum` function.

4. **Exiting the REPL:** To exit the REPL, simply type:

```julia
exit()
```

Or press `Ctrl-D` (on most systems).

### REPL Modes

The Julia REPL has different prompt modes that can be very useful to install / remove packages, run shell commands, search for help, etc.
The different modes are:

- The Julian mode
- Help mode
- Package mode
- Shell mode

Visit the [command-line REPL](https://docs.julialang.org/en/v1/stdlib/REPL/) page for more details.

::: {.panel-tabset}

#### Help mode

By pressing `?` you can obtain information and metadata about Julia objects (functions, types, etc.) or unicode symbols.
The query fetches the docstring of the object, which explains how to use it.

```julia
help?> println
```

If you don't know the exact name you are looking for, type a word surrounded by quotes to see in which docstrings it pops up.
To come back to Julia mode, hit backspace.

#### Package mode

By pressing `]` you access [Pkg.jl](https://github.com/JuliaLang/Pkg.jl), Julia's integrated package manager.
Please visit the [documentation](https://pkgdocs.julialang.org/v1/getting-started/) for details.
Pkg.jl allows you to:

* `]activate` different local, shared or temporary environments;
* `]instantiate` them by downloading the necessary packages;
* `]add`, `]update` (or `]up`) and `]remove` (or `]rm`) packages;
* get the `]status` (or `]st`) of your current environment.

As an illustration, we download the package Plots.jl inside our current environment:

```julia
pkg> add Plots
```

Note that you can do the same in Julia mode:

```julia
julia> using Pkg
julia> Pkg.rm("Plots")
```

The package mode itself also has a help mode, accessed with `?`.
To come back to Julia mode, hit backspace.

#### Shell mode

By pressing `;` you enter a terminal, where you can execute any command you want.
Here's an example for Unix systems:

```julia
shell> pwd
```

To come back to Julia mode, hit backspace.

## Running Julia Scripts

While the Julia REPL is great for interactive experimentation, you’ll often want to write and run larger programs. This is where running Julia scripts comes in.

### Creating a Julia Script

A Julia script is a plain text file that contains Julia code. You can create a Julia script using any text editor, such as VS Code, Sublime Text, or even a simple text editor. 

Save the file with the `.jl` extension, for example `myscript.jl`.

### Running a Julia Script

To run a Julia script, open your terminal or command prompt, navigate to the directory where the script is located, and then use the following command:

```bash
julia myscript.jl
```

This will execute the code in `myscript.jl` and output any results in the terminal. If your script includes print statements, those outputs will be displayed. See the [command-line interface](https://docs.julialang.org/en/v1/manual/command-line-interface/) page for more details.

### Example: Running a Script

Here’s an example of a simple Julia script:

```julia
# myscript.jl
println("Hello, World!")
x = 10
y = 20
println("The sum of x and y is ", x + y)
```

To run this script, save it as `myscript.jl` and use the command:

```bash
julia myscript.jl
```

The output will look like this:

```julia
Hello, World!
The sum of x and y is 30
```

### Running Scripts with Arguments

You can also pass command-line arguments to a Julia script. For example, let's modify the script to accept arguments:

```julia
# args_example.jl
println("Arguments passed to the script: ", ARGS)
```

Now, when running the script, you can pass arguments like this:

```bash
julia args_example.jl arg1 arg2 arg3
```

The output will be:

```julia
Arguments passed to the script: ["arg1", "arg2", "arg3"]
```

You can access the arguments as elements of the `ARGS` array within your script.

### Running Julia Scripts from the REPL

You can also run Julia scripts directly from the REPL by using the `include()` function. To run the `myscript.jl` script, for example:

```julia
include("myscript.jl")
```

This command will execute the code in the script, and you’ll see the output in the REPL.

### Running Julia Scripts in IDEs

If you’re using an IDE like VS Code with the Julia extension, you can run the script directly from within the editor by pressing the "Run" button or using the appropriate keyboard shortcut. This is convenient for testing and iterating on your code without having to switch back and forth between the editor and the terminal. See the [Running Code](https://www.julia-vscode.org/docs/stable/userguide/runningcode/) page from Julia in VS Code documentation for more details.

<img width="100%" src="../assets/images/myscript.png"/>

## Editors and Ides

While any text editor can be used to write Julia code, Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) significantly enhance the programming experience. Notable options for Julia include Visual Studio Code (VS Code), Jupyter, Pluto.jl, Vim, and Emacs. Each of these editors offers unique features like interactive environments, real-time code feedback, and specialized plugins for a smoother development process. For instance, VS Code with the Julia extension is the most feature-rich IDE for Julia, while Jupyter provides an interactive notebook environment. Pluto.jl focuses on reactive notebooks, and Vim and Emacs offer efficient, customizable text editing solutions.

The best IDE for Julia is [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/), or VS Code, developed by Microsoft.
Indeed, the [Julia VS Code extension](https://www.julia-vscode.org/) is the most feature-rich of all Julia IDE plugins.
You can download it from the VS Code Marketplace and read its [documentation](https://www.julia-vscode.org/docs/stable/).

::: {.callout-tip}
To use Julia in Visual Studio Code, please follow these [steps](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/languages/julia), where you can find 
how to install Julia, VS Code and the necessary extensions.

To gain time, you can learn the keyboard shortcuts for:

- [Windows](https://code.visualstudio.com/shortcuts/keyboard-shortcuts-windows.pdf),
- [macOS](https://code.visualstudio.com/shortcuts/keyboard-shortcuts-macos.pdf),
- [Linux](https://code.visualstudio.com/shortcuts/keyboard-shortcuts-linux.pdf).

  <img src="../assets/images/logo-jupyter.svg" height="85" width="85" alt="Jupyter Logo" style="float: left; margin: 0px 1em 1em auto;">
</a>

You can write Jupyter notebooks and use the [Jupyter](https://jupyter.org) interactive environment. To do so you need to install
the [IJulia.jl](https://github.com/JuliaLang/IJulia.jl) package. IJulia is a [Julia-language](http://julialang.org/) backend
combined with the [Jupyter](http://jupyter.org/) interactive environment (also used by [IPython](http://ipython.org/)).  This 
combination allows you to interact with the Julia language using Jupyter/IPython's powerful 
[graphical notebook](http://ipython.org/notebook.html), which combines code, formatted text, math, and multimedia in a single 
document. IJulia is a Jupyter language kernel and works with a variety of notebook user interfaces. In addition to the classic 
Jupyter Notebook, IJulia also works with [JupyterLab](https://jupyterlab.readthedocs.io/en/stable/), a Jupyter-based
integrated development environment for notebooks and code. The [nteract notebook desktop](https://nteract.io/) supports IJulia with 
detailed instructions for its [installation with nteract](https://nteract.io/kernels/julia). Please visit this

## Julia Documentation

One of the key strengths of Julia is its comprehensive and easy-to-navigate documentation. Julia’s official documentation provides detailed explanations of the language features, standard libraries, and tools available for developers.

### Official Documentation

The official Julia documentation is a complete reference guide for the language. You can find it here:

- [Julia Documentation Website](https://docs.julialang.org)

This documentation covers everything from basic syntax to advanced topics like parallel computing and package management.

**Example.** Search how to compute the norm of a vector.

<img width="100%" src="images/doc-norm-1.png"/>

The `norm` function comes from the standard librairy `LinearAlgebra`.

<img width="100%" src="images/doc-norm-2.png"/>

However, we are not directly at the right place, so I recommend to use the `Search docs` field.

<img width="100%" src="images/doc-norm-3.png"/>

And now, we have the documentation.

<img width="100%" src="images/doc-norm-4.png"/>

::: {.callout-note}
You can also access the Julia documentation directly from the Julia REPL using the `?` (help) command.
:::

### Accessing Help in the REPL

The REPL provides a built-in help system that can assist you in looking up functions, types, and more. Here’s how you can use it:

1. **Look up a function or keyword**: Type `?` followed by the function name or keyword you want help with.
   
   ```julia
   ?println
   ```

   This will display the documentation for the `println` function.

2. **Search for a keyword**: You can also type just `?` followed by a search term to find relevant functions or types in the documentation.
   
   ```julia
   ?array
   ```

   This will display documentation related to arrays in Julia.

### Additional Resources

- **Julia Language GitHub**: [Julia GitHub Repository](https://github.com/JuliaLang/julia) — Contains the source code and development discussion.
- **Julia Discourse**: [Julia Discourse Forum](https://discourse.julialang.org) — A community forum where you can ask questions, share ideas, and discuss Julia-related topics.
- **JuliaLang Slack**: [Join Slack Community](https://julialang.slack.com/join/shared_invite/zt-2tyfzahid-QwVkpO13UA~9hyffV7UYMg#/shared-invite/email) — An official Slack workspace for the Julia community.

## Working with Julia Packages

Julia has a rich ecosystem of packages that extend the language’s capabilities for various domains, such as machine learning, data science, optimization, and more. The [Julia Packages](https://juliapackages.com) webpage is the official source for Julia packages. This section will cover how to manage and use packages in Julia.

### Standard Libraries in Julia

Julia comes with a set of [standard libraries](https://docs.julialang.org/en/v1/), which are built-in packages available with the installation. These libraries cover a wide range of functionality, from mathematical operations to file handling and system utilities. You do not need to install them separately; they are ready to be used as soon as you start Julia.

One commonly used standard library is [`LinearAlgebra`](https://docs.julialang.org/en/v1/stdlib/LinearAlgebra/), which provides tools for linear algebra, such as matrix factorizations and vector operations.

#### Example: Computing the Norm of a Vector

The `LinearAlgebra` library can be used to compute the norm of a vector. Here's how you can do that:

```{julia}
using LinearAlgebra

# Define a vector
v = [3, 4]

# Compute the Euclidean norm (magnitude) of the vector
norm_v = norm(v)

println("The norm of the vector is: ", norm_v)
```

In this example, the `norm()` function calculates the Euclidean norm (or 2-norm) of the vector `v`, which in this case is 

$$
\sqrt{3^2 + 4^2} = 5.
$$

These standard libraries help you to get started quickly with common tasks, without the need to install additional packages.

### Installing Packages

To install a package, you can use the `Pkg` module, which is part of Julia's standard library. Here's how to install a package:

1. Enter the package manager mode by typing `]` in the REPL.
2. Then, use the `add` command to install a package.

Example:

```julia
] add DataFrames
```

This will install the `DataFrames` package, which is widely used for data manipulation in Julia. To get the list of installed packages, type:

```julia
] status
```

::: {.callout-note}
You can also install the package directly from the Julia mode:

```julia
using Pkg
Pkg.add("DataFrames")
```
:::

### Using Installed Packages

Once a package is installed, you can use it by importing it into your code using the `using` keyword. This makes the functions and types of the package available for use.

Example:

```{julia}
using DataFrames

df = DataFrame(A = 1:4, B = ["a", "b", "c", "d"])
```

This creates a simple `DataFrame` object with two columns `A` and `B`.

### Updating Packages

To update the packages installed in your environment to their latest versions, use the `update` command in the package manager.

Example:

```julia
] update
```

You can also update a specific package by running:

```julia
] update PackageName
```

::: {.callout-note}
You can also update packages directly from the Julia mode:

```julia
using Pkg
Pkg.update()
# or
Pkg.update("PackageName")
```
:::

### Removing Packages

If you no longer need a package, you can remove it using the `rm` command.

Example:

```julia
] rm DataFrames
```

This will uninstall the `DataFrames` package from your environment.

::: {.callout-note}
You can also remove packages directly from the Julia mode:

```julia
using Pkg
Pkg.rm("DataFrames")
```
:::

### Package Environments

In Julia, you can manage different environments, each with its own set of installed packages. This allows you to work on multiple projects with different dependencies without conflicts. You can create a new environment by navigating to a directory and typing:

```julia
] activate .
```

This will activate the environment in the current directory. You can also specify a different directory or environment path by providing it after `activate`. If you want
to come back to the global environment, type:

```julia
] activate
```

Note that the packages installed in the global environment are visible from any other environment. See the [Working with Environments](https://pkgdocs.julialang.org/v1/environments/) page for more details.

::: {.callout-note}
You can also activate environments directly from the Julia mode. For instance, for the current directory:

```julia
using Pkg
Pkg.activate(".")
```
:::

### Sneak peek behind the scenes

In practice, a **package** is a collection of organized code, which often includes one or more modules, along with additional resources like documentation and tests. Packages are designed to be reusable and shareable, enabling users to install and integrate them into different projects. 

A **module**, on the other hand, serves as a namespace that helps organize code into logical units while preventing naming conflicts. It isolates its contents from the global scope, ensuring a clean and structured codebase. But these are concepts we will go deeper into later in this lecture.

```julia
module MyModule
export my_function

function my_function(x)
    return x + 1
end
end
```

Within a package, modules are accessed using the `using` keyword, allowing you to leverage the functionality provided by the module in your own code.

### Conclusion

Working with packages is essential to leveraging Julia’s powerful ecosystem. Understanding how to install, update, and remove packages, as well as using environments to manage project-specific dependencies, will help you make the most out of Julia's vast libraries.

## Julia Ecosystem
