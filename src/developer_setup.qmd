As a beginner Julia developers, you have learned interactive coding within the REPL. The content of this page will help you level-up by explaining how to use scripts and Integrated Development Environments (IDEs). Scripts allow you to write and save code in files, making it easier to test, reuse, and share your work. This is essential for building real-world projects, where your code will often be longer and more complex. IDEs provide helpful tools like auto-completion, debugging, syntax highlighting, and version control integration, which improve productivity and help catch errors early (avoiding tedious debugging hours...). Using scripts and IDEs sets you up with good habits and gives you the structure needed to grow as a developer.

## Running Julia Scripts

While the Julia REPL is great for interactive experimentation, you’ll often want to write and run larger programs. This is where running Julia scripts comes in.

### Creating a Julia Script

A Julia script is a plain text file that contains Julia code. You can create a Julia script using any text editor, such as VS Code, Sublime Text, or even a simple text editor. 

Save the file with the `.jl` extension, for example `myscript.jl`.

### Running a Julia Script

To run a Julia script, open your terminal or command prompt, navigate to the directory where the script is located, and then use the following command:

```bash
julia myscript.jl
```

This will execute the code in `myscript.jl` and output any results in the terminal. If your script includes print statements, those outputs will be displayed. See the [command-line interface](https://docs.julialang.org/en/v1/manual/command-line-interface/) page for more details.

### Example: Running a Script

Here’s an example of a simple Julia script:

```julia
# myscript.jl
println("Hello, World!")
x = 10
y = 20
println("The sum of x and y is ", x + y)
```

To run this script, save it as `myscript.jl` and use the command:

```bash
julia myscript.jl
```

The output will look like this:

```julia
Hello, World!
The sum of x and y is 30
```

### Running Scripts with Arguments

You can also pass command-line arguments to a Julia script. For example, let's modify the script to accept arguments:

```julia
# args_example.jl
println("Arguments passed to the script: ", ARGS)
```

Now, when running the script, you can pass arguments like this:

```bash
julia args_example.jl arg1 arg2 arg3
```

The output will be:

```julia
Arguments passed to the script: ["arg1", "arg2", "arg3"]
```

You can access the arguments as elements of the `ARGS` array within your script.

### Running Julia Scripts from the REPL

You can also run Julia scripts directly from the REPL by using the `include()` function. To run the `myscript.jl` script, for example:

```julia
include("myscript.jl")
```

This command will execute the code in the script, and you’ll see the output in the REPL.

### Running Julia Scripts in IDEs

If you’re using an IDE like VS Code with the Julia extension, you can run the script directly from within the editor by pressing the "Run" button or using the appropriate keyboard shortcut. This is convenient for testing and iterating on your code without having to switch back and forth between the editor and the terminal. See the [Running Code](https://www.julia-vscode.org/docs/stable/userguide/runningcode/) page from Julia in VS Code documentation for more details.

## Editors and Ides

While any text editor can be used to write Julia code, Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) significantly enhance the programming experience. Notable options for Julia include Visual Studio Code (VS Code), Jupyter, Pluto.jl, Vim, and Emacs. Each of these editors offers unique features like interactive environments, real-time code feedback, and specialized plugins for a smoother development process. For instance, VS Code with the Julia extension is the most feature-rich IDE for Julia, while Jupyter provides an interactive notebook environment. Pluto.jl focuses on reactive notebooks, and Vim and Emacs offer efficient, customizable text editing solutions.

The best IDE for Julia is [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/), or VS Code, developed by Microsoft.
Indeed, the [Julia VS Code extension](https://www.julia-vscode.org/) is the most feature-rich of all Julia IDE plugins.
You can download it from the VS Code Marketplace and read its [documentation](https://www.julia-vscode.org/docs/stable/).

::: {.callout-tip}
To use Julia in Visual Studio Code, please follow these [steps](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/languages/julia), where you can find 
how to install Julia, VS Code and the necessary extensions.

To gain time, you can learn the keyboard shortcuts for:

- [Windows](https://code.visualstudio.com/shortcuts/keyboard-shortcuts-windows.pdf),
- [macOS](https://code.visualstudio.com/shortcuts/keyboard-shortcuts-macos.pdf),
- [Linux](https://code.visualstudio.com/shortcuts/keyboard-shortcuts-linux.pdf).

  <img src="../assets/images/logo-jupyter.svg" height="85" width="85" alt="Jupyter Logo" style="float: left; margin: 0px 1em 1em auto;">
</a>

You can write Jupyter notebooks and use the [Jupyter](https://jupyter.org) interactive environment. To do so you need to install
the [IJulia.jl](https://github.com/JuliaLang/IJulia.jl) package. IJulia is a [Julia-language](http://julialang.org/) backend
combined with the [Jupyter](http://jupyter.org/) interactive environment (also used by [IPython](http://ipython.org/)).  This 
combination allows you to interact with the Julia language using Jupyter/IPython's powerful 
[graphical notebook](http://ipython.org/notebook.html), which combines code, formatted text, math, and multimedia in a single 
document. IJulia is a Jupyter language kernel and works with a variety of notebook user interfaces. In addition to the classic 
Jupyter Notebook, IJulia also works with [JupyterLab](https://jupyterlab.readthedocs.io/en/stable/), a Jupyter-based
integrated development environment for notebooks and code. The [nteract notebook desktop](https://nteract.io/) supports IJulia with 
detailed instructions for its [installation with nteract](https://nteract.io/kernels/julia). Please visit this

## Working with Julia Packages

Julia has a rich ecosystem of packages that extend the language’s capabilities for various domains, such as machine learning, data science, optimization, and more. The [Julia Packages](https://juliapackages.com) webpage is the official source for Julia packages. This section will cover how to manage and use packages in Julia.

### Standard Libraries in Julia

Julia comes with a set of [standard libraries](https://docs.julialang.org/en/v1/), which are built-in packages available with the installation. These libraries cover a wide range of functionality, from mathematical operations to file handling and system utilities. You do not need to install them separately; they are ready to be used as soon as you start Julia.

One commonly used standard library is [`LinearAlgebra`](https://docs.julialang.org/en/v1/stdlib/LinearAlgebra/), which provides tools for linear algebra, such as matrix factorizations and vector operations.

#### Example: Computing the Norm of a Vector

The `LinearAlgebra` library can be used to compute the norm of a vector. Here's how you can do that:

```{julia}
using LinearAlgebra

# Define a vector
v = [3, 4]

# Compute the Euclidean norm (magnitude) of the vector
norm_v = norm(v)

println("The norm of the vector is: ", norm_v)
```

In this example, the `norm()` function calculates the Euclidean norm (or 2-norm) of the vector `v`, which in this case is 

$$
\sqrt{3^2 + 4^2} = 5.
$$

These standard libraries help you to get started quickly with common tasks, without the need to install additional packages.

### Installing Packages

To install a package, you can use the `Pkg` module, which is part of Julia's standard library. Here's how to install a package:

1. Enter the package manager mode by typing `]` in the REPL.
2. Then, use the `add` command to install a package.

Example:

```julia
] add DataFrames
```

This will install the `DataFrames` package, which is widely used for data manipulation in Julia. To get the list of installed packages, type:

```julia
] status
```

::: {.callout-note}
You can also install the package directly from the Julia mode:

```julia
using Pkg
Pkg.add("DataFrames")
```
:::

### Using Installed Packages

Once a package is installed, you can use it by importing it into your code using the `using` keyword. This makes the functions and types of the package available for use.

Example:

```{julia}
using DataFrames

df = DataFrame(A = 1:4, B = ["a", "b", "c", "d"])
```

This creates a simple `DataFrame` object with two columns `A` and `B`.

### Updating Packages

To update the packages installed in your environment to their latest versions, use the `update` command in the package manager.

Example:

```julia
] update
```

You can also update a specific package by running:

```julia
] update PackageName
```

::: {.callout-note}
You can also update packages directly from the Julia mode:

```julia
using Pkg
Pkg.update()
# or
Pkg.update("PackageName")
```
:::

### Removing Packages

If you no longer need a package, you can remove it using the `rm` command.

Example:

```julia
] rm DataFrames
```

This will uninstall the `DataFrames` package from your environment.

::: {.callout-note}
You can also remove packages directly from the Julia mode:

```julia
using Pkg
Pkg.rm("DataFrames")
```
:::

### Package Environments

In Julia, you can manage different environments, each with its own set of installed packages. This allows you to work on multiple projects with different dependencies without conflicts. You can create a new environment by navigating to a directory and typing:

```julia
] activate .
```

This will activate the environment in the current directory. You can also specify a different directory or environment path by providing it after `activate`. If you want
to come back to the global environment, type:

```julia
] activate
```

Note that the packages installed in the global environment are visible from any other environment. See the [Working with Environments](https://pkgdocs.julialang.org/v1/environments/) page for more details.

::: {.callout-note}
You can also activate environments directly from the Julia mode. For instance, for the current directory:

```julia
using Pkg
Pkg.activate(".")
```
:::

### Conclusion

Working with packages is essential to leveraging Julia’s powerful ecosystem. Understanding how to install, update, and remove packages, as well as using environments to manage project-specific dependencies, will help you make the most out of Julia's vast libraries.
