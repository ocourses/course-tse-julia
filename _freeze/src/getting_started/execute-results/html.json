You'll learn how to install Julia on different operating systems and how to verify the installation. It also covers using the Julia REPL for interactive coding. Additionally, this page provides resources for learning and getting help with Julia based on the official documentation.\n\n## Installing Julia\n\n### Download Julia\n\nTo get started with Julia, you first need to install the language on your computer. The official Julia website provides the installation files for various operating systems, including Windows, macOS, and Linux. Follow these steps:\n\n1. Visit the official [Julia Downloads](https://julialang.org/downloads/) page.\n2. Choose the appropriate version of Julia for your operating system.\n3. Download the installer (the latest stable version is recommended for most users).\n\n### Installation Instructions\n\nBefore you can start using Julia, you need to install it on your system. Below are the steps for installing Julia on different operating systems: Mac, Linux, and Windows.\n\n::: {.panel-tabset}\n\n### Mac / Linux\n\nTo install the latest stable version of Julia on Mac or Linux, follow these simple steps:\n\n1. Open your terminal.\n2. Run the following command to download and install Julia:\n\n```bash\ncurl -fsSL https://install.julialang.org | sh\n```\n\nThis command downloads the Julia installation script and runs it automatically. It will install Julia and place it in your /usr/local/bin directory by default.\n\n### Windows\n\nTo install Julia on Windows, follow these steps:\n\n1. Open the [Microsoft Store page for Julia](https://www.microsoft.com/store/apps/9NJNWW8PVKMN).\n2. Click \"Get\" to download and install the latest version of Julia from the Microsoft Store.\n\nAlternatively, you can install Julia using the Windows Package Manager (winget). Open the command prompt and run the following command:\n\n```bash\nwinget install julia -s msstore\n```\n\nAfter installation, you can launch Julia by searching for it in the Start menu or by running julia in the command prompt.\n:::\n\n### Verify Installation\n\nAfter installation, you can verify that Julia is correctly installed by opening a terminal or command prompt and typing the following command:\n\n```bash\njulia\n```\n\nThis will launch the Julia REPL (Read-Eval-Print Loop), where you can start running Julia commands interactively. You should see something similar to the following:\n\n::: {#65e13eaa .cell execution_count=2}\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-display .cell-output-markdown execution_count=3}\n```julia\n               _\n   _       _ _(_)_     |  Documentation: https://docs.julialang.org\n  (_)     | (_) (_)    |\n   _ _   _| |_  __ _   |  Type \"?\" for help, \"]?\" for Pkg help.\n  | | | | | | |/ _` |  |\n  | | |_| | | | (_| |  |  Version 1.11.6 (2025-07-09)\n _/ |\\__'_|_|_|\\__'_|  |  Official https://julialang.org/ release\n|__/                   |\n\n\njulia>\n```\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\nIf you see this prompt, it means Julia is installed and **working correctly!**\n\n## Using the Julia REPL\n\nThe [Julia REPL](https://docs.julialang.org/en/v1/stdlib/REPL/) (Read-Eval-Print Loop) is an interactive command-line environment for executing Julia code. It allows you to run Julia code line-by-line, evaluate expressions, and see the results immediately. \n\nYou have already used it when checking the installation of Julia by typing `julia` in a terminal or command prompt. Let us start typing Julia expressions.\n\n### Basic Commands\n\nIn the REPL, you can type expressions and commands. For example:\n\n- To perform a simple arithmetic operation, type:\n\n```julia\n3 + 4\n```\n\nThe result will appear right below the command, like so:\n\n```julia\n7\n```\n\n- To assign a value to a variable, use the `=` sign:\n\n```julia\nx = 10\n```\n\nNow, `x` holds the value 10. You can use it in further expressions:\n\n```julia\nx * 2\n```\n\nThe result will be:\n\n```julia\n20\n```\n\n### Using REPL Features\n\nThe Julia REPL has several features that make it more convenient to use:\n\n1. **History:** You can use the up and down arrow keys to scroll through your command history and reuse previous commands.\n\n2. **Tab Completion:** Type part of a function or variable name and press `Tab` to automatically complete it or show suggestions.\n\n3. **Help:** Type `?` followed by a function or type name to get documentation directly in the REPL. For example:\n\n```julia\n?sum\n```\n\nThis will show information about the `sum` function.\n\n4. **Exiting the REPL:** To exit the REPL, simply type:\n\n```julia\nexit()\n```\n\nOr press `Ctrl-D` (on most systems).\n\n### REPL Modes\n\nThe Julia REPL has different prompt modes that can be very useful to install / remove packages (libraries), run shell commands, search for help, etc.\nThe different modes are:\n\n- The Julia mode\n- Help mode\n- Package mode\n- Shell mode\n\nVisit the [command-line REPL](https://docs.julialang.org/en/v1/stdlib/REPL/) page for more details.\n\n::: {.panel-tabset}\n\n#### Help mode\n\nBy pressing `?` you can obtain information and metadata about Julia objects (functions, types, etc.) or unicode symbols.\nThe query fetches the docstring of the object, which explains how to use it.\n\n```julia\nhelp?> println\n```\n\nIf you don't know the exact name you are looking for, type a word surrounded by quotes to see in which docstrings it pops up.\nTo come back to Julia mode, hit backspace.\n\n#### Package mode\n\nBy pressing `]` you access [Pkg.jl](https://github.com/JuliaLang/Pkg.jl), Julia's integrated package manager.\nPlease visit the [documentation](https://pkgdocs.julialang.org/v1/getting-started/) for details.\nPkg.jl allows you to:\n\n* `]activate` different local, shared or temporary environments;\n* `]instantiate` them by downloading the necessary packages;\n* `]add`, `]update` (or `]up`) and `]remove` (or `]rm`) packages;\n* get the `]status` (or `]st`) of your current environment.\n\nAs an illustration, we download the package Plots.jl inside our current environment:\n\n```julia\npkg> add Plots\n```\n\nNote that you can do the same in Julia mode:\n\n```julia\njulia> using Pkg\njulia> Pkg.rm(\"Plots\")\n```\n\nThe package mode itself also has a help mode, accessed with `?`.\nTo come back to Julia mode, hit backspace.\n\n#### Shell mode\n\nBy pressing `;` you enter a terminal, where you can execute any command you want.\nHere's an example for Unix systems:\n\n```julia\nshell> pwd\n```\n\nTo come back to Julia mode, hit backspace.\n\n:::\n\n## Julia Documentation\n\nOne of the key strengths of Julia is its comprehensive and easy-to-navigate documentation. Julia’s official documentation provides detailed explanations of the language features, standard libraries, and tools available for developers.\n\n### Official Documentation\n\nThe official Julia documentation is a complete reference guide for the language. You can find it here:\n\n- [Julia Documentation Website](https://docs.julialang.org)\n\nThis documentation covers everything from basic syntax to advanced topics like parallel computing and package management.\n\n**Example.** Search how to compute the norm of a vector.\n\n<img width=\"100%\" src=\"images/doc-norm-1.png\"/>\n\nThe `norm` function comes from the standard librairy `LinearAlgebra`.\n\n<img width=\"100%\" src=\"images/doc-norm-2.png\"/>\n\nHowever, we are not directly at the right place, so I recommend to use the `Search docs` field.\n\n<img width=\"100%\" src=\"images/doc-norm-3.png\"/>\n\nAnd now, we have the documentation.\n\n<img width=\"100%\" src=\"images/doc-norm-4.png\"/>\n\n::: {.callout-note}\nYou can also access the Julia documentation directly from the Julia REPL using the `?` (help) command.\n:::\n\n### Accessing Help in the REPL\n\nThe REPL provides a built-in help system that can assist you in looking up functions, types, and more. Here’s how you can use it:\n\n1. **Look up a function or keyword**: Type `?` followed by the function name or keyword you want help with.\n   \n   ```julia\n   ?println\n   ```\n\n   This will display the documentation for the `println` function.\n\n2. **Search for a keyword**: You can also type just `?` followed by a search term to find relevant functions or types in the documentation.\n   \n   ```julia\n   ?array\n   ```\n\n   This will display documentation related to arrays in Julia.\n\n### Additional Resources\n\n- **Julia Language GitHub**: [Julia GitHub Repository](https://github.com/JuliaLang/julia) — Contains the source code and development discussion.\n- **Julia Discourse**: [Julia Discourse Forum](https://discourse.julialang.org) — A community forum where you can ask questions, share ideas, and discuss Julia-related topics.\n- **JuliaLang Slack**: [Join Slack Community](https://julialang.slack.com/join/shared_invite/zt-2tyfzahid-QwVkpO13UA~9hyffV7UYMg#/shared-invite/email) — An official Slack workspace for the Julia community.\n- **Julia Community**: [Julia Community](https://julialang.org/community/) — A hub for Julia community resources, including events, blogs, and videos.\n\n",
